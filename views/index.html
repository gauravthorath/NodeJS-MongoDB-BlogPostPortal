      Node.js is literally packed with amazing features and tools to make our
      lives easier. However, as we know, working with dependencies can be quite
      troublesome most of the time due to problems that can arise with
      testability and code manageability. There is a solution for that, and itâ€™s
      called dependency injection. Dependency injection is a software design
      pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected, or
      passed by reference, into a dependent object. By using dependency
      injection inside our Node.js applications, you can: Streamline the unit
      testing process, passing dependencies directly to the modules you would
      like to use instead of hardcoding them Avoid useless modules coupling,
      making maintenance much easier
